## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by our Code of Conduct. By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to the project maintainers.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before contributing, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.10+**: Required for the CLI core functionality
- **Node.js 18+**: Required for Playwright browser automation  
- **Git 2.0+**: For version control
- **pip**: Python package manager (usually included with Python)

### Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Bugsterapp/bugster-cli.git
   cd bugster-cli
   ```

2. **Set up Python environment**
   ```bash
   # Create virtual environment (recommended)
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   
   # Install in development mode
   pip install -e .
   ```

3. **Install development dependencies**
   ```bash
   # Install additional development tools
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Install Node.js dependencies**
   ```bash
   # Install Playwright for testing
   npx playwright install
   ```

5. **Verify installation**
   ```bash
   # Test the CLI
   bugster --help
   ```

6. **Set up pre-commit hooks** (optional but recommended)
   ```bash
   pip install pre-commit
   pre-commit install
   ```

## How to Contribute

### Types of Contributions

We welcome several types of contributions:

- **Bug reports**: Help us identify and fix issues
- **Feature suggestions**: Propose new functionality
- **Code contributions**: Implement bug fixes or new features
- **Documentation improvements**: Enhance README, guides, or code comments
- **Testing**: Add or improve test coverage

### Before You Start

For significant changes:

1. **Check existing issues**: Look for related issues or discussions
2. **Create an issue**: Discuss your proposed changes before implementing
3. **Get feedback**: Wait for maintainer feedback before starting work

For minor changes (typos, small bug fixes), you can proceed directly to a pull request.

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

Types:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes

### Review Process

1. Automated checks must pass (CI/CD)
2. At least one maintainer review required
3. Address review feedback promptly
4. Maintain clean commit history

## Code Style Guidelines

### Python Code Style

We use several tools to maintain code quality:

- **Ruff**: For linting and formatting
- **Pre-commit hooks**: Automated style checking

```bash
# Run linting
ruff check .

# Auto-fix issues
ruff check --fix .

# Format code
ruff format .
```

### General Guidelines

- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Add docstrings for public functions and classes
- Keep functions focused and small
- Follow PEP 8 conventions
- Use type hints where appropriate
